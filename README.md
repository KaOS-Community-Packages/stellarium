Stellarium is a free open source planetarium for your computer. It shows a realistic sky in 3D, just like what you see with the naked eye, binoculars or a telescope.

*A port of Stellarium for mobile devices is available for Android, iOS. These have a limited functionality, lacking some features of the desktop version, but include support for gyroscope and compass capabilities. All versions use OpenGL to render a realistic projection of the night sky in real time.*
